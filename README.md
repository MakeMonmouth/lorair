# LoRAIR - A LoRaWAN Air Quality Monitor for Citizen Science projects

We've stolen a lot of the ideas behind the incredible [sensor.community](https://sensor.community/en/) design, but we're using LoRaWAN instead of WiFi and sending the data to Grafana.

## Development Environment

We use [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management, [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) for the sensor code, and [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for the documentation.
